        "question":"Can I eat breakfast before the surgery?",
        "answer":"Before cataract surgery, you\u2019ll usually be asked not to eat or drink anything for at least 6 hours beforehand. This is to reduce the risk of complications from anesthesia. If your surgery is in the morning, you\u2019ll likely need to skip breakfast. However, some clinics allow small sips of water or clear fluids up to 2 hours before. Always follow the exact instructions your doctor or surgical team gives you\u2014they\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s safe for your specific case. If you\u2019re unsure, call the clinic to confirm.",

        "question":"What are the dos and donts after surgery?",
        "answer":"After cataract surgery, do rest your eyes, use prescribed eye drops, and wear the protective shield as advised. Keep the eye clean and avoid rubbing it. Don\u2019t lift heavy objects, bend over deeply, swim, or expose your eye to dust or dirty water for at least a week. Avoid eye makeup and strenuous exercise until your doctor says it\u2019s safe. Wear sunglasses outdoors to protect from bright light. Attend all follow-up appointments to monitor healing. If you notice pain, worsening vision, or redness, contact your doctor promptly. Always follow your surgeon\u2019s specific instructions for the best recovery.",

        "question":"How safe is the surgery?",
        "answer":"Cataract surgery is very safe and one of the most common surgeries worldwide. Over 95% of cases improve vision without serious complications. Modern techniques use small incisions and quick recovery times. Risks like infection, swelling, or retinal detachment are rare but possible. Most side effects, such as mild discomfort or blurred vision, are temporary and resolve within days or weeks. Your surgeon will check your eye health beforehand to minimize risks. Following aftercare instructions helps ensure a smooth recovery. If you have other eye conditions, discuss them with your doctor to understand your personal risk better.",
